# Tutorial10
We've seen how JSON objects (that are easier to store and transmit) were parsed to plain Javascript objects (That are easier to process programmatically),  but now that we have more sophisticated objects, we might need to transform plain objects to those sophisticated ones.  
In the given starter code, we have a josn file the contains some properties about different shapes. In our program, we defined different classes to represent the different types of shapes. So a transformation step was needed to translate the plain objects to objects of the specific type based on the type property.
The code was split into different files for modularization. You just need to add what is necessary to make those files work together.
